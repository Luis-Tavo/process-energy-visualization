# CO2 Absorption Energy Surface Modeling

This Python script visualizes and models energy consumption in CO2 absorption processes. It uses 3D plots and surface fitting to show how Lean Loading Factor and Reboiler Temperature affect the Energy required for solvent regeneration.

## Usage

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed. Then, install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy scipy
    ```

2.  **Run the code:**
    Copy the entire `main_plot.py` script content into your Python environment (e.g., a `.py` file, Jupyter Notebook cell, or IDE). Then, execute the script.

    An interactive window will open, displaying the 3D plot with automatic rotation.
